# Regression to Study the spread of COVID-19
Date: December 2020

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have endeavored to control the spread of COVID-19
by limiting population mobility through enforcing face mask mandates and stay home orders, in order to
reduce close contacts.

Our research question is – Is there a causal relationship between mobility and the spread of COVID-19 cases
during February 2020 to June 2020 period? Furthermore, what other factors affect such relationships? We
hypothesize that face mask mandates and Stay-At-Home orders, which are primary reasons for population’s
mobility change to residential, also have impacted the spread of COVID-19.

Our research can help build a stronger understanding of the relationship between political interventions and
the trend of a pandemic. The outcomes could suggest whether implementation of political orders are effective,
and also provide reference for political leaders to take effective measures preventing the spread of futher
epidemics.
